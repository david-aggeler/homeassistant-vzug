# API Versions

## 1.5.0

- Doesn't have the `alterable` key in commands. All commands are alterable by default.
- Returns `null` instead of an empty list for `getCategories` when there are no categories.
- `getUpdateStatus` isn't supported.

## 1.7.0

This is the version the devices I own are using. As such, I am using this as the baseline.

## 1.8.0

Somehow this my AdoraDish device reports both 1.7.0 and 1.8.0 depending on the endpoint that I use...
